Minimalist AutoLogin Plus focuses on simplicity, clarity, and intent.

It streamlines the login process by minimizing visual noise and removing unnecessary interface elements, allowing players to move from login to character selection with speed and focus. Account panels and auxiliary buttons can be hidden entirely, resulting in a cleaner and more deliberate user experience.

Beyond visual refinement, the addon enhances account and character handling logic, ensuring safer defaults, predictable behavior, and improved consistency when logging in, relogging, or returning from /logout.

This addon is not about adding more —
it is about keeping only what truly matters.

Design Philosophy

Minimalist AutoLogin Plus is built around a single principle:

Less interface. More intention.

Every element that does not serve clarity is removed or silenced.
Every action behaves in a predictable and consistent way.

The addon stays invisible — until it is needed.
